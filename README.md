Custom US Keyboard Layout
=========================

OS X’s US keyboard layout modified to suit my tastes.

What’s different
----------------

- It’s easier to type Ä and Ö. Fellow Finns — you’re welcome.

- The mappings for curly quotes have been changed so that they make more
  sense.

- The ability to type a non-breaking space using ⌥ Space has been removed.
  Accidentally typing one in your code is amazingly annoying to debug! Now it
  just types a regular space.

Modified mappings

Key combination | Result

⇧⌥A             | Ä
⇪⌥A             | Ä
⌥O              | ö
⇧⌥O             | Ö

⌥ Space         | `U+0020`
